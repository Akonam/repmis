	Version 0.02
- Add tools to install old R package versions both in a stand alone function (`InstallOldPackages`) and as part of `LoadandCite`.

- the `package` argument for `LoadandCite` is depricated. Use `pkgs` to match `install.packages syntax better. 

	Version 0.01.1
Documentation and external package load fixes.

	Version 0.01
Includes the functions `LoadandCite` for loading and citing R packages as well as `source_GitHubData` for downloading plain-text data from GitHub.
