  Version 0.02.2
Change how default repo in `LoadandCite` is determined/set.

  Version 0.02.1
`LoadandCite` repo option now gets repo information from `.Rprofile`. Thanks to Karthik Ram.

  Version 0.02
- Add tools to install old R package versions both in a stand alone function (`InstallOldPackages`) and as part of `LoadandCite`.

- the `package` argument for `LoadandCite` is depricated. Use `pkgs` instead. This is so the syntax matches `install.packages syntax better. 

	Version 0.01.1
Documentation and external package load fixes.

	Version 0.01
Includes the functions `LoadandCite` for loading and citing R packages as well as `source_GitHubData` for downloading plain-text data from GitHub.
