The command also creates a [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) bibliography file with package citations.\r\n\r\n- `InstallOldPackages`: installs specific R package versions.\r\n\r\n- `source_data`: loads plain-text formatted data stored at a URL (both http and https) into R. **Note:** the command can download data from any secure (`https`) URL. This includes *published* Google Docs plain-text formatted data sets (see [Google Docs support pages](http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=37579) for details).\r\n\r\n- `source_GitHubData`: a function for loading plain-text formatted data (e.g. CSV, TSV) into R. This function is basically a wrapper for `source_data`.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe package is available for download from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/). \r\n\r\nYou can also download the most recent version using the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) command `install_github` to install **repmis** in R. Here is the exact code for installing the current version:\r\n\r\n```r\r\ndevtools::install_github(\"repmis\", \"christophergandrud\")\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-985930-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
