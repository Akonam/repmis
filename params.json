The command also creates a [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) bibliography file with package citations.\r\n\r\n- `InstallOldPackages`: installs specific R package versions.\r\n\r\n### Functions for loading data into R from the internet:\r\n\r\n- `source_data`: loads plain-text formatted data (e.g. CSV, TSV) stored at a URL (both http and https) into R. **Note:** the command can download data from almost any secure (`https`) URL. This includes data in Dropbox Public folders and *published* Google Docs plain-text formatted data sets (see [Google Docs support pages](http://support.google.com/drive/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=37579) for details. Note, currently *only the old Google Sheets supports publishing* sheets to the Web as plain-text files.)\r\n  - `source_data`, and all of the data download commands in *repmis* find and report [SHA-1 hashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) for each file it loads. You can use a file's SHA-1 hash to make sure you are downloading the file and version of the file you think you are downloading. Note: if you are using `source_data` to download data from GitHub, `source_data`'s SHA-1 hash is *not the same as* the Git commit's SHA-1 hash. (Thanks to Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package for the code to make this possible.)\r\n  - Data downloaded with  `source_data` can be cached (so you don't have to re-download it every time you run a script. To do this use the `cache` argument.\r\n\r\n- `source_DropboxData`: loads plain-text formatted data stored in a Dropbox **non-Public** folder. See [this blog post](http://christophergandrud.blogspot.com/2013/04/dropbox-r-data.html) for more details. Also, if you are looking for full Dropbox control (not just data downloading) from R see Karthik Ram's [rDrop](https://github.com/karthikram/rDrop) package.\r\n\r\n- `source_XlsxData`: downloads and loads a data set in Excel format. The function relies on the [xlsx](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/xlsx/index.html) package and can take any arguments that `read.xlsx` can.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\nThe package is available for download from [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/repmis/).\r\n\r\nYou can also download the most recent version using the [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) command `install_github` to install **repmis** in R. Here is the exact code for installing the current version:\r\n\r\n```{S}\r\ndevtools::install_github('christophergandrud/repmis')\r\n```\r\n","google":"UA-985930-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
